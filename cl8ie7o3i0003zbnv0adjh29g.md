## Want to avoid Elm for the front-end? Check these 3 reasons

Some decisions are tough. You need some good reasons to avoid Elm, but you can't just say NO. Here are three decent reasons to avoid Elm for the front-end.

Why me? I created a 
[Pluralsight course about the fundamentals of Elm 0.19](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/elm-zero-dot-19-fundamentals/table-of-contents).
Also, I wrote [three reasons to use Elm for the front-end](https://programmingwithdan.com/three-reasons-to-use-elm-for-the-front-end), to argue the other way around.


# Too stable

Elm is too stable, some argue it's stale: latest release is from October 2019, which is like medieval times in JavaScript years. 

Evan Czaplicki - the brilliant creator of Elm - [added a roadmap](https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/roadmap.md) in February 2021. TLDR: **high quality, no hurry**. He has kept his promise.


# Small community

It's a niche tool, so the community is relatively small. How about community events? Well, **elm-conf** [was cancelled in 2020](https://2020.elm-conf.com/), due to '*reduced organizer capacity.*' Still, [Elm Slack](https://elm-lang.org/community/slack) has about 22k members. Despite its small size, the community is active and helpful.


# Frozen perspectives

What are Elm's long-term perspectives? If we were to think of Elm as a stock, what can we expect from it?

Look at this Google Trends picture, which compares Elm, TypeScript and React :

Elm looks frozen: stable, small, and no expectations of some sudden future increase. Still, it pays dividends by offering high-quality and stability.


# Bottom line
Elm is very stable, the community is too small, and its future perspectives are frozen for now.
